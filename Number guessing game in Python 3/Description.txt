Number guessing game in Python 3 

Suppose the user defines the range from 1 to 100, and the system randomly selects 42 as the target number. The guessing process might look like this:

Guess 1: 50 → Too high
Guess 2: 25 → Too low
Guess 3: 37 → Too low
Guess 4: 43 → Too high
Guess 5: 40 → Too low
Guess 6: 41 → Too low
Guess 7: 42 → Correct!
